hellooooooooo, my name is raven! 
i've already created a github profile in the past but i decided to delete that account and start anew for the purpose of reigniting my excitement for programming.
hopefully this time i'll actually stick to it and fall in love with it once again.

now, a little bit about myself:
i am currently not in college right now as i've decided to take a year off after senior high school. i've been on and off school due to mental health complications.
right now, i'm delving into several hobbies and interests at once. namely:
  - learning the japanese language (as well as its different writing systems)
  - studying math and science from the ground up (from really basic elementary school stuff to advanced calculus)
  - producing creative artworks (visual, literary, musical, etc.)
  - programming (starting from javascript at the odin project)
  - MUSIC (listening to playlists and albums religiously and organizing music obsessively)
  - calisthenics & cardio workouts
  - anime & manga
  - reading books
  - watching films
  - playing the guitar + singing
  - dancing

as you can see, it is a lot, and you might say "where do you get the time to do all these?" and the answer is: i don't sleep ;) plus really good time management (and a fuckton of coffee).

my main goal in programming:
- since i am in love with music, organizing playlists is one of my daily obsessions. i've built such empire on my spotify account with 200+ playlists. however, i have this really irrational fear of spotify gettting deleted one day. so, like an obsessive person i am, i duplicated every single song on every single playlist i have from spotify to my google docs account. but it's proven to be really tedious to maintain everything. so i'm learning programming to create an app that automatically duplicates everything i add to my spotify personal library. that's been my main goal ever since.

am i going to take a programming-related course in college?
- i don't think i'm going to pursue a computer science course even though that's what i initially wanted when i was in senior high school. i eventually realized that it's not my passion and i can't really do it for an extended period of time in such a pressurized environment (school). sure, having a tech-related job is pretty convenient and gives out a lot of money, but it's not something i'd love to do. art has always been the love of my life, so i'm thinking of taking multimedia arts in college. i almost took computer science just because of the reason from the previous paragraph.

anyways, that's about it, i don't have much else to say and share. i'm a really shy and introverted person so i think i'll only barely interact with people on here.
programming isn't my passion but i am willing to give time and effort to learn how to.
